# Fluid-Mechanics-Buoyancy
```
Simulating fluid behavior such as buoyancy to make 2d game objects float. 
```
## Summary
```
Recreating the fluid behavior of New Super Mario Bros. In Mario game, water enemy when frozen will rise up due to buoyancy.<br>
When the game object(frozen enemy) is in water, it will push the object upwards, if it's over the water surface level, <br> it will be pulled down by the gravitational force until it reaches water again where it will be pushed up again until it finds a balance.
